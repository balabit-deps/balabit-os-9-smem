Description: memory reporting tool
 Tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems.
 Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS),
 which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used
 by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.
 .
 This package contains main tool which can also process data collected
 by smemcap.

Description: data collection tool for memory reporting
 Tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on Linux systems.
 Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional set size (PSS),
 which is a more meaningful representation of the amount of memory used
 by libraries and applications in a virtual memory system.
 .
 This package contains smemcap utility, which can be used to collect
 data on resource constrained systems without depending on Python.
 .
 The captured data can be processed by smem program.
